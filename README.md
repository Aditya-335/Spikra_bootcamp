# RAG Chatbot (LangChain + Streamlit)

This project is a production-style **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built with:

- **Streamlit** (UI)
- **LangChain** (RAG logic)
- **Google Gemini** (LLM + Embeddings)
- **Chroma** (Vector store)

It lets users **chat with their own PDFs**, maintains **conversation memory**, and supports **multiple conversations** ‚Äî similar to ChatGPT's chat history.

## üöÄ How It Works

> The app implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** as follows:

1. PDFs are split into text chunks
2. Embeddings are generated using Google's model
3. Chroma indexes them for semantic search
4. User questions retrieve relevant chunks
5. The LLM generates grounded answers

‚úÖ If no PDFs are uploaded, it falls back to normal assistant chat.
